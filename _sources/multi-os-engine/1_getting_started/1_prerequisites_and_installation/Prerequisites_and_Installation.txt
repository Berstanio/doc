The easiest way to install Xcode is from the Mac App Store. Just launch the App Store app on your Mac and search for Xcode. After you select Install, the download will start. The Command Line Tools and the iOS SDK are included in this download, so you won't have to install those separately.

After Xcode is installed, you will have to launch it to finish the installation process. Please make sure that the :guilabel:"Command Line Tools" are correctly installed. You can trigger Command Line Tools installation by running console command::

	xcode-select --install

To verify that you have successfully installed Xcode Command Line Tools, run::

	$ xcode-select -p
	/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

Apple developer certificate is needed in order to run the code on a physical iPhone and iPad. Please make sure that Apple ID associated with an Apple Developer Program is added in the Accounts preferences pane in Xcode preferences. If it's not listed, choose the + button to add it:
