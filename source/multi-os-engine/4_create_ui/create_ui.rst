The Multi-OS Engine provides two options for defining the layout and UI for your Apple iOS applications:

•   By using the UI designer which is available within Android Studio* after you install the Multi-OS Engine UI Designer plugin from the standard plugin repository.
•   By using Apple Xcode* Interface Builder and generating Java bindings in Android Studio.

For more information about each approach, see:
